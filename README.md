# Configuration

## UNIX

### Filesystem

`.` at the beginning of a filename indicates a hidden file.

`~` at the end of a filename indicates a backup file.

`~` as a directory path refers to the users home directory, which is `/home/username`.

### Terminal

TAB either completes a command (when there is no ambiquity) or shows the available completions for it. It does not modify the input when there is ambiquity.

`ls -a` prints all (non-hidden and hidden) files.
